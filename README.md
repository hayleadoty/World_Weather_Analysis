# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of our analysis was to create an application where customers can select vacation travel destinations based on their weather preferences. The customer inputs their preferred low and high temperature range, and the application provides them with ideal travel destinations based on their temperature preferences, along with nearby hotels. If the customer wishes to visit multiple cities on their vacation, they can then create their own travel itinerary for four cities. A travel route is then generated between the four cities chosen, along with a marker layer map.
