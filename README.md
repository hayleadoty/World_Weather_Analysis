# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of our analysis was to create an application where travelers can select travel destinations based on their weather preferences. The traveler inputs their preferred low and high temperature range, and the application provides them with ideal travel destinations and nearby hotels. The traveler can then create their own travel itinerary containing four cities. A travel route is then generated between the four cities chosen, along with a marker layer map.
